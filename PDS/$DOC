  Here are a couple of words of explanation for the VM XEDIT macro:

  REXXFOR1 is a VM REXX exec which has been written to beautify and
  reformat other REXX execs.  It is in the form of an XEDIT macro.
  You XEDIT the REXX exec on VM, and run the XEDIT macro REXXFORM,
  which reformats the exec that's being edited (I think.  You have
  to try it).

  Lionel Dyck has converted the VM REXXFORM exec (now renamed to member
  REXXFOR1) to an ISPF edit macro to run under z/OS.  The converted z/OS
  product is presented here as member REXXFORM, which is an XMIT-format
  unloaded pds.  You create the pds for REXXFORM by executing the
  command:

    (TSO) RECEIVE INDS('this.pds(REXXFORM)')

  where the "TSO" is only necessary when you execute this command from
  the ISPF command line.

  Remember that the TSO command RECEIVE is from IBM, and therefore it
  has a HELP member in SYS1.HELP.  If you have any question about how to
  use the RECEIVE command, go to its help member (named RECEIVE).

  So the REXXFORM member in this pds now contains an ISPF edit macro
  which can be used to reformat (and beautify) other REXX execs under
  z/OS.
